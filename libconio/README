========================================================


Introduction
------------

"libconio" is part of "libemb". It provides a simple to use API for writing text to a console. Currently the console is the first USART on the STM32.  The library is not HW dependend since the HW part is provided by "libserial". Thus, this library is dependend on "libserial" form the "libemb" project.
